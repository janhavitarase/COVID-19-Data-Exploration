# COVID-19-Data-Exploration

This project focused on analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL, a powerful database querying language. The dataset contained crucial information such as infection rates, mortality statistics, and vaccination data.

The primary objectives were to extract meaningful insights and trends from the data. SQL queries were utilized for data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.

Key aspects of the project included calculating infection rates per region, identifying hotspots, and assessing the impact of various factors like vaccination rates on infection rates. Time-series analyses were also conducted to track the evolution of the pandemic over time.

Through SQL, this project enabled efficient data manipulation and extraction of valuable information, aiding in understanding the pandemic's progression, identifying areas of concern, and informing public health decisions. It exemplified the power of SQL in handling and analyzing complex and evolving datasets like COVID-19 statistics.
